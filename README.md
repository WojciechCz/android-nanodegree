# Repository for Android Nanodegree course projects.

## About Nanodegree program
Learn to develop for Android and transform your career outlook!
This Nanodegree will provide a guided, efficient path for an intermediate developer with little or no experience on mobile platforms to emerge as an Android Developer.

By the end of the Nanodegree, you’ll have a diverse portfolio of projects to show employers, and will even publish your own app on the Google Play Store as part of the Capstone project.

This is an Intermediate Nanodegree: Entering students are expected to have prior experience building applications (web or mobile) in Java or another object-oriented programming language.

## Projects
* **Personal App Portfolio**
Design and build an app that shows off the apps that you’ll create as part of this Nanodegree.

* **Popular Movies, Stage 1**
Build an app to help users discover popular and recent movies. You will build a clean UI, sync to a server, and present information to the user.

* **Popular Movies, Stage 2**
Add onto your project from Stage 1 with a detail view for each movie, allowing users to ‘favorite’ movies, and adding a tablet layout.

* **Super Duo: Productionize Two Apps**
Productionize two apps, taking them from a functional state to a production-ready state. To do this, you will find and handle error cases, add accessibility features, allow for localization, add widgets, and add a library.

* **Build It Bigger**
Use Gradle to build a joke-telling app, factoring functionality into libraries and flavors to keep the build simple. You’ll also configure a Google Cloud Endpoints development server to supply the jokes.

* **Make Your App Material**
Implement Android design concepts and transform a functional newsreader app using material design techniques.

* **Go Ubiquitous**
Let users access the weather at a glance by building a Sunshine watch face for Android Wear.

* **Capstone, Stage 1: Design, Scope and Plan Your App**
Create a detailed plan, including UI mocks and technical specifications, for building your own app.

* **Capstone, Stage 2: Build and Polish Your App for Production**
This is your chance to take the skills that you’ve learned across your Nanodegree journey and apply it to an app idea of your own.
